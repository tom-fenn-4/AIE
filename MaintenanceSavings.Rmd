```{r}
n <- 10000
ms <- runif(n, 10, 20)
ls <- runif(n, -2, 8)
rms <- runif(n, 3, 9)
pl <- runif(n, 15000, 35000)

savings <- (ms + ls + rms) * pl


```

Summary statistics on savings and histograms of each variable and the result.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(lattice)
summary(savings)
histogram(ms)
histogram(ls)
histogram(rms)
histogram(savings)
```

The cost of the equipment and the probability of breaking even

```{r}
cost <- 400000
breakeven <- savings >= cost
sum(breakeven)/length(breakeven)
```
