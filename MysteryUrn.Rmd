An urn contains 1000 marbles that are either red or green.   An unknown fraction is green.   What is the probability of being correct, if the result of a single draw is used to determine the majority color.

```{r}
n <- 10000
fraction_green <- runif(n)
majority_green <- fraction_green > 0.5
draw_green <- runif(n) < fraction_green
is_correct <- draw_green & majority_green | !draw_green & !majority_green
fraction_correct <- sum(is_correct)/length(is_correct)
fraction_correct
```
