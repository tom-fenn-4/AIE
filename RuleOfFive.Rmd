The rule of 5 states that the median of a distribution will be located between the min and max of 5 samples most of the time.  What is the actual percentage?  What about the mean?

```{r}
sim_results <- function(n, f) {
  d <- matrix(f(n*5), nrow = 5)
  lbound <- apply(d, 2, min)
  ubound <- apply(d, 2, max)
  sum(lbound < 0 & ubound > 0)/n 
}

sim_results(1e5, rnorm)
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(lattice)
```
